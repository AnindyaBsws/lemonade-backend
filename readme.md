IMPORTANT NOTES

    Query: 
    A query is a question or a request for information expressed in a formal manner.
    In general, a query is a request for information. In the context of databases, a query is a formal request to retrieve, modify, or manipulate data within a database. It can also be used to perform actions like inserting, updating, or deleting data, as well as combining information from multiple tables. 

    Query Pagination: 
    Query pagination is a technique used to split a large result set from a database query into smaller, more manageable chunks called pages. This approach is crucial for applications that deal with a lot of data, as it improves user experience and optimizes database performance by avoiding the need to load and display the entire result set at once. 

    Agrregation Pipleline: 
    In MongoDB, aggregation is a powerful process for transforming and analyzing data within collections. It's essentially a pipeline of stages that process documents and return computed results, allowing you to filter, group, sort, and perform other operations on your data. Think of it like an assembly line where each stage processes the data and passes it to the next, ultimately resulting in a transformed or summarized output. 
    
    Key Concepts:

    1.Aggregation Pipeline: A series of stages that process documents in sequence. 
    2.Stages: Each stage performs a specific operation, such as filtering with $match, grouping with $group, or sorting with $sort. 
    3.Operators:Within each stage, you use operators to perform specific actions on the data. For example, $sum to calculate the total of a field or $avg to calculate the average. 
    4.Document Transformation:Each stage modifies the documents as they pass through, eventually resulting in aggregated or summarized output. 
    5.Computed Results:The final output of the aggregation pipeline are documents that contain the results of the operations performed.
